# Demand-forecasting-system
# Description:
A demand forecasting system predicts future product demand based on historical sales data. This is crucial for inventory management, logistics, and production planning. In this project, we build a simple time series forecasting model using Linear Regression with lag features to forecast future demand.

# ðŸ“¦ What This Project Demonstrates:
* Uses lag features for time series regression forecasting

* Predicts future product demand using historical sales data

* Visualizes forecasted vs actual demand

* Evaluates model with MSE and RÂ² score
